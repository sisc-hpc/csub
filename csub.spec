%description
This repository contains code to generate a csub script, this is wrapper script around qsub and blcr,
which will take a command, and automatically checkpoint it. If a job is about to run out of it's wall
time, the script will use blcr to checkpoint all it's information, and resubmit it, until the command
is done. This currently does not work very well for multi threaded jobs, and not at all for mpi jobs.
